Array|Array|Linear|An array comprises a set of elements (values or variables) that are distinguished by at least one array index or key. The array is arranged in a manner that enables the position of each element to be determined by applying a mathematical formula to its index. 
Two Dimension Array|Array|Linear|A two-dimensional array is analogous to a table or grid that is comprised of rows and columns. Each element in the array can be located by specifying its position using both horizontal and vertical reference numbers. These arrays are occasionally referred to as matrices. 
List|List|Linear|A sequence or list is an abstract data type that signifies a limited collection of ordered values, where identical values may appear more than once. 
Linked list|List|Linear|A linked list is a linear arrangement of data elements where their physical position in memory does not define their order. Rather, each element points to the next element in the sequence. This data structure is constructed by combining nodes that collectively represent the sequence. 
Self-Balance Tree|Tree|Non-Linear|A self-balancing tree refers to any binary search tree that operates on nodes and automatically maintains a low height (the maximum number of levels beneath the root) regardless of the random insertion or removal of items. 
Heap|Tree|Non-Linear|A heap is a specialized data structure based on a tree that is nearly complete and meets the heap property. This structure is one of the most effective ways to implement a priority queue, which is an abstract data type. Priority queues are sometimes called "heaps." 
Binary Search Tree|Tree|Non-Linear|A binary search tree (BST), also known as a sorted or ordered binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure in which every internal node stores a key that is greater than all the keys stored in its left subtree and less than the keys in its right subtree. 
Graph|Graphs|Non-Linear|A graph data structure is composed of a limited number of vertices, combined with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph, that are used to implement the undirected and directed graph principles in the area of graph theory in mathematics. 
Set|Abstract|Non-Linear|A set is an abstract data type that can hold unique values, without any particular sequence. It is a computerised representation of the mathematical notion of a finite set. In contrast to many other data structures, rather than retrieving a particular element from a set, it is typical to check whether a value is a member of a set. 
Queue|Abstract|Linear|A queue is a series of elements that are arranged in a specific order and can be adjusted by adding new elements at one end of the series and removing existing elements from the other end of the series. 
Stack|Abstract|Linear|A stack is an abstract data type that functions as a collection of elements and features two main fundamental operations: Push, which inserts an element into the collection, and Pop, which takes out the most recently added element that has not yet been removed. 
Hash Table|Hash|Non-Linear|A hash table is a data structure that implements an abstract data type called an associative array, which maps keys to values. By employing a hash function, the hash table calculates an index, commonly known as a hash code, and then searches for the desired value in an array of buckets or slots.
