Array,Array,Linear,An array data structure consists of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. 
Two Dimension Array,Array,Linear,A two-dimensional array can be visualised as a grid (or table) with rows and columns. Positions in a two-dimensional array are referenced like a map using horizontal and vertical reference numbers. They are sometimes called matrices. 
List,List,Linear,A list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once. 
Linked list,List,Linear,A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. 
Self-Balance Tree,Tree,Non-Linear,A self-balancing tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. 
Heap,Tree,Non-Linear,A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property. The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue; priority queues are often referred to as "heaps". 
Binary Search Tree,Tree,Non-Linear,A binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node’s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. 
Graph,Graphs,Non-Linear,A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics. 
Set,Abstract,Non-Linear,A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set. 
Queue,Abstract,Linear,A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. 
Stack,Abstract,Linear,A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. 
Hash Table,Hash,Non-Linear,A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
